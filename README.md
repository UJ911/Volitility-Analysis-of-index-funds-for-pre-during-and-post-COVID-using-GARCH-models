Volitility Analysis of S&P-500 using GARCH models

finalresults(2).ipynb - Contains code which fits precovid, during covid and post covid data to ARCH(1), ARCH(2), GARCH(1/2,1/2), EGARCH(1/2,1/2), T-GARCH(1/2,1/2), GJR-GARCH(1/2,1/2).
It also contains a 7 day volitility forcast(non-rolling) with all its models.It also contains the residues of these models(actual-fitted) values over along with their residue distribution to show channging dynamics of these models.

model_evaluation_metrics.csv - csv file which contains AIC, BIC,Log_likelihood, MSE training, MSE testing(non-rolling), MAE training, MAE testing(non-rolling) for all the fitted models.
